## 1. [**Vitamin D and the risk of treatment resistant and atypical depression: a Mendelian randomization study**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651066821) 

### Presenter: Ryan Arathimos (King's College London)

Co-authors: Ryan Arathimos, Amy Ronaldson, Laurence J Howe, Chiara Fabbri, Saskia Hagenaars, Matthew Hotopf, Fiona Gaughran, Cathryn M Lewis, Alexandru Dregan

Synopsis: Using both observational data and Mendelian randomization in the UK Biobank, we investigated associations of vitamin D with two depression subtypes; treatment-resistant (TRD) and atypical (AD) depression. Results did not support a causal link between vitamin D and two subtypes of depression, but do not rule out that small effects may exist that require larger sample sizes to detect.

## 2. [**Using within-family polygenic scores to predict cognitive differences between siblings**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651068216) 

### Presenter: Ziye Wang (Queen Mary University of London and King's College London)

Co-authors: Ziye Wang, Francesca Procopio, Agnieszka Gidziela, Quan Zhou, Margherita Malanchini, Kaili Rimfeld, Robert Plomin

Short summary: The predictive power of polygenic scores for cognitive traits has been shown to be substantially lower within-families (i.e. when predicting sibling differences) than between-families. Using summary statistics from a landmark new GWAS of within-sibship differences, this study aims to examine how well polygenic scores derived from a within-family GWAS can predict cognitive differences between siblings.

## 3. [**Copy Number Variant Analysis in the Middle Eastern Genomes Project**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651068084) 

### Presenter: Luke Peacock (St George's, University of London)

Co-authors:  Luke Peacock, Reza Maroofian, Ehsan Karimiani, Paria Najarzadeh, Chris Carroll, Yalda Jamshidi*, Alan M Pittman*

Synopsis: In this study, we analysed Whole Exome Sequencing samples from a cohort of predominantly consanguineous families with neurological, cardiac and muscular disorders from Iran and surrounding regions. We developed a bioinformatic framework for the identification of Copy Number Variants (CNVs) in this cohort and built a web application to enhance research collaboration and facilitate identification of genetic causes of disease. Using this web application, we have successfully identified disease causing CNVs in this cohort and hope to expand the functionality of this application to yield further findings.

## 4. [**Is there an association between daytime napping, cognitive function and brain volume? A Mendelian randomisation study in the UK Biobank**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651068015) 

### Presenter: Valentina Paz (University College London and Universidad de la República, Uruguay.)

Co-authors:  Valentina Paz, Hassan S. Dashti & Victoria Garfield

Synopsis:
- Daytime napping has been linked with cognitive function and brain health in
observational studies but whether these associations are causal, remains elusive.
- Using Mendelian randomisation, we investigated the potential causal role of
habitual daytime napping on cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes.
- We observed evidence of a causal association between habitual daytime napping
and larger total brain volume, but not enough evidence to support associations
with hippocampal volume, reaction time or visual memory.

## 5. [**Understanding polygenic effects on early development and proximal environments**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651067956) 

### Presenter: Dr Emma Meaburn (Birkbeck, University of London)

Co-authors: Sara Selvarajah, Bonamy R. Oliver, Anna Gui, Rebecca Harrison, Greg Pasco, Jannath Begum Ali, Hamel Patel, Charles Curtis, Tony Charman, Mark H. Johnson, Emily J. H. Jones, Emma L. Meaburn and the BASIS Team

Synopsis: Recent polygenic score studies have reminded us that separating genetic effects from environmental effects is not a solved problem in molecular genetic studies, with robust evidence that the polygenic score for time spent in education (PGSEduYrs) captures ‘genetic nurture’ effects. Important questions remain as to how early environmental transmission of PGSEduYrs effects are detectable, and what the relevant mediation environments might be. We explored these questions in an infant sample with and without a family history of autism for whom family wide PGSEduYrs , early learning ability and parent-infant interaction data were available.

## 6. [**Consanguinity and disease in British Individuals with South Asian Ancestry**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651067788) 

### Presenter: Daniel S Malawsky (Wellcome Sanger Institute)

Co-authors: Daniel S Malawsky, Eva S van Walree, Elena Arciero, Karen A Hunt, Sufyan A Dogra, Dan Mason, John Wright, Danielle Posthuma, Sarah Finer, David A van Heel, Hilary C Martin

Synopsis: We investigated consanguinity patterns and associations between autozygosity and common diseases in >20,000 British Individuals with South Asian ancestry from the Genes & Health cohort (G&H). 61% of British individuals with Pakistani ancestry and 27% of British individuals with Bangladeshi ancestry were inferred to be offspring of second cousins or closer, with consanguinity being less common in younger than in older BIBAs, but the opposite is true for BIPAs, suggesting changing marriage practices across time. Using electronic health records, we tested associations between ICD-10 codes and the fraction of the genome in ROHs (FROH) while controlling for population structure and social confounders, where we found that FROH is significantly associated with overall health and various organ systems including the respiratory and auditory systems.

## 7. [**Genetic and environmental influences on neurodevelopmental disorders and their comorbidity with disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders during childhood and adolescence: A meta-analysis**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651067730) 

### Presenter: Agnieszka Gidziela (Queen Mary, University of London)

Co-authors: Agnieszka Gidziela, Yasmin Ahmadzadeh, Giorgia Michelini, Andrea Allegrini, Jessica Agnew-Blais, Lok Yan Lau, Megan Duret, Francesca Procopio, Emily Daly, Johanna Erickson, Angelica Ronald, Robert Plomin, Kaili Rimfeld & Margherita Malanchini

Synopsis: A systematic understanding of the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and of their comorbidities during childhood and adolescence remains incomplete. The current meta-analysis bridges major gaps in our knowledge by synthesising the literature on the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to NDDs, the genetic and environmental overlap between different NDD categories, as well as between NDDs and disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders (DICCs). While our work provides fundamental first-hand knowledge to inform and potentially guide clinical and educational diagnostics and practice, it also highlights the major lack of neurodiversity that has characterized developmental genetic research into NDDs and their comorbidities.

## 8. [**Recessive burden analysis and gene discovery in ~40,000 developmental disorder trios with diverse ancestries**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651067122) 

### Presenter: Kartik Chundru (Wellcome Sanger Institute)

Co-authors: V. Kartik Chundru, Zhancheng Zhang, Kaitlin E. Samocha, Rebecca I. Torene, Matthew E. Hurles, Kyle Retterer, Hilary C. Martin

Synopsis: We are using a large dataset of whole exome sequenced trios to detect recessive acting developmental disorder genes. We have a much more diverse set of samples, as well as a much larger sample size than previous studies. Preliminary results show an enrichment in Loss of function, and damaging missense variants, and implicates known developmental disorder genes.

## 9. [**The development and value assessment of a precision medicine-based cardiovascular disease risk score in a South African setting**](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9026355/video/651067010) 

### Presenter: Michelle Kamp (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and Kings College London)

Co-authors: Michelle Kamp, Cathryn Lewis, Michele Ramsay

Synopsis: The proposed methodology and preliminary results of the study investigating the development and value assessment of a precision medicine-based cardiovascular disease risk score in a South African setting. Initial results suggest positive perceptions of precision medicine in the South African public health setting despite limited knowledge and exposure to precision medicine. The cost of genomic testing and limited genetic services resources were identified as substantial barriers to implementation.
