# About this event

For 2024 we are celebrating **new beginnings** â€“ all our speakers have recently moved institution or moved between academic and industry.

<br>

We are thrilled to announce a fantastic schedule of outstanding speakers from London institutions in London and the surrounding areas (see below).

<br>

Following the science talks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions about careers at a Q&A panel discussion with a diverse panel of researchers working in human genetics who have recently made a career change (institution, country, industry, etc).

There will be networking opportunities during the lunch and coffee breaks, and the event will be followed by a drinks reception!

<br>

# Venue

The event will be held at the University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH.

The University of Surrey is easily accessible; there are direct trains from London Waterloo and Clapham Junction. 

The university is a short walk from Guildford train station.

<br>

# Post-meeting social

There will be a **post-meeting drinks reception** from 5 to 7 pm.
