Dear all,

We are delighted to announce that **registration is now open** for the special themed <a href="https://www.londongeneticsnetwork.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">London Genetics Network</a> meeting on **Monday, April 29th, from 12.30 pm!**

***

# About this event

For 2024 we are celebrating **new beginnings** â€“ all our speakers have recently moved institution or moved between academia and industry.

We are thrilled to announce a fantastic schedule of outstanding speakers from institutions in London and the surrounding areas (see below).

Following the science talks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions about careers at a Q&A panel discussion with a panel of researchers working in human genetics who have recently made a career change (institution, country, industry, etc).

There will be networking opportunities during the lunch and coffee break, and the event will be followed by a drinks reception!
