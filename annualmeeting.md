# Poster competition and carer award

The London Genetics Network invites poster presentations for the Annual Meeting 2021. The online posters will be in the form of short videos. Academics affiliated with an institution based in London or the surrounding areas are eligible to submit a poster for the meeting. There will also be a poster competition for Early Career Researchers and a carer award that eligible participants can apply for. Detailed instructions are below.

  </p>

## Instructions on how to record your video poster
 
Step 1 – Prepare your poster using Powerpoint. We recommend a single slide
with background, methods, results and discussion sections. 
 
Step 2 – Prepare the script for the talk that you want to give alongside your poster.
 
Step 3 – Record your talk on Zoom (or other recording software if preferred). Use the zoom function from within the presenter’s view (usually in the bottom left of the screen) to zoom in on specific sections of your poster as you talk through them, so that viewers of your video poster can clearly see each section of your poster. Particular care should be taken to make sure figures and tables are clearly visible when discussing results.

Many people already have a Zoom account from their university or workplace. If you do not have an account already you can make a free account at [https://zoom.us/](https://zoom.us/)
 
The final video should be under 5 minutes long, aim for 3-5 minutes.
 
Once you have a Zoom account when you are ready to record your presentation follow the steps below
1.	Open your presentation
2.	Start a zoom call
3.	If you are muted, click unmute and if your video camera is not on, click the start video symbol 
4.	Click Share Screen 
5.	Select your presentation in the dialogue box that opens up and click share 
6.	Make your presentation full screen. You can resize the windows to make the video of yourself speaking bigger or smaller as you prefer.
7.	In the screen sharing menu click More then click Record or Record on this Computer (If the meeting control panel has disappeared from view, you can see it again by hovering your cursor over the green “You are screen sharing” bar)
8.	A red circle will show up in the menu this indicates you are being recorded
9.	Present your work. If you want to pause the recording use the menu
10.	When you are finished use the menu to stop the recording and stop the screen share then end the meeting
11.	Zoom will then convert the video and save it 
12.	If you are using a PC you can find the saved mp4 file in Documents\zoom. If you are using a Mac you can find the file in Documents/Zoom/date‐time‐stamped‐folder
13.	Feel free to edit your view if you want. 
14.	Once you are happy with your presentation, rename the file with the following format: SURNAME.mp4 
15.	Email the mp4 file, as well as the poster file in pdf format, to londongeneticsnetwork@gmail.com together with the following information
a.	Name
b.	Position
c.	Institution
d.	Whether you are an Early Career Researcher (ECR) or non-ECR
e.	Poster title
f.	Co-authors 
g.	A short synopsis of no more than 3 sentences
 
Feel free to use a different software to record your video if you prefer. However, please make sure that the video is in mp4 format.

Please send your video poster to <a href="mailto:londongeneticsnetwork@gmail.com">londongeneticsnetwork@gmail.com</a>. 

For the poster competition, posters will be judged by an independent poster committee of London-based human geneticists.
