The London Genetics Network is funded by the Genetics Society and is designed for researchers working in human genetic research in London and the surrounding areas. The Network’s aims are: 

* to increase London-based collaboration between researchers interested in human genetics
* to leverage London’s expertise by fostering knowledge exchange 
* to develop practical and online resources for training and development in statistical and computational genetics
* to support early career researchers through a range of new opportunities and research prizes
