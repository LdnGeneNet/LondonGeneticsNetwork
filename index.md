The London Genetics Network is a new network founded by Professor Angelica Ronald (Birkbeck, GEL lab co-director) and Dr Karoline Kuchenbaecker (UCL). The Network is funded by the Genetics Society and is designed for researchers working in human genetic research in London and the surrounding areas. The Network’s aims are: 

* to increase London-based collaboration between researchers interested in human genetics
* to leverage London’s expertise by fostering knowledge exchange 
* to develop practical and online resources for training and development in statistical and computational genetics
* to support early career researchers through a range of new opportunities and research prizes
