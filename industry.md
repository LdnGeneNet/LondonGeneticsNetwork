Studying in the genetics and genomics field can lead to a career in health, scientific research or industry. Whether you're looking for a collaborator, a traineeship or a move to industry, networking is important. So, one of the initiatives we're starting at the LGN is to build a network of individuals in various industry roles who would be interested in working with/interacting with LGN members.  

If there's someone you've worked with in the past that you think we should contact, or if there's someone you would really like us to invite to speak then please get in touch at the email below. We hope to organise an initial networking event to bring together industry and academia in the genomics field, and we'd love to hear your thoughts on this. We'll be posting further updates on this page so feel free to check back again.
