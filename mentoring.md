# Mentoring Scheme

The London Genetic Network mentoring scheme aims to provide career support to early-career researchers (ECR) and mid-career researchers (MCR) within the LGN.

Our scheme offers ECRs and MCRs the opportunity to be paired with an experienced researcher who can provide support with personal and professional development. Mentors act as a facilitator and sounding board to guide the mentee to navigate and discover their own direction. Examples of topics that mentors can provide support or guidance in:

  </p>

Mentor-mentee partnership pairs are encouraged to establish an agreement of communication structure that suits both parties including the frequency and format of interaction. It is the responsibility of the mentee to facilitate and maintain the partnership.

**The mentor-mentee matching process will take place during Summer/early Autumn 2021 and the mentoring program will officially launch in mid-Autumn 2021**.

# Peer Support Scheme

The LGN peer support scheme aims to provide a platform for small group meetings and discussion forums amongst researchers who are on a similar career track and with similar levels of experience. Everyone is a mentor, a mentee and an advocate for each other in this program. We hope that by providing a platform for open and honest discussion, all parties can widen their support network. **This scheme will launch mid-Autumn 2021.**
